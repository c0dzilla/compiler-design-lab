Compiler Design Laboratory assignments as part of BTech Computer Science and Engineering curriculum IIT Roorkee.

If you have somehow stumbled upon this repository, please do not copy any of the assignments. If you're stuck somewhere, feel free to have a look inside for reference.
Even if circumstances are extremely dire(harsh deadline/you messed up time management), try to learn as much as you can.

_Disclaimer:_ I have not checked whether this repo is updated or not, and hence do not vouch for its correctness.
